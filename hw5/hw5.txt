Homework 5

To solve this homework problem I used continuations whenever the matcher had
more than one possible match. This continuation would become the most recent
backtrack location and I would then pass it to any matcher methods called
afterwards. Once a match was found in the scope of the current function,
the backtrack location would be passed as the tail of the return value. If at
any point the matcher could not match the input fragment to its current pattern,
then (backtrack) is called, bringing execution back to the last continuation.
This continuation will be return false and cause the matcher to consider the
next option until all backtrack locations are exhausted.
