I struggled at the beginning of this project to understand functional programming
enough to handle the assignment. The idea of creating a function that returned
another function based on functions in the parameters didn't make sense to me 
at first, especially with recursion thrown in. However once I wrapped my head 
around it I was able to start. My first attempt tried to map about the entire
grammar given the input and return a matcher. However this didn't work on
recursive languages since it is impossible to map out all possible fragments.
I realized that most of the functionality shouldnt actually execute until the
fragment is inputted, so I changed my function to return a function that
would take the acceptor and fragment then map out the grammar alongside the
fragment.

One of the weaknesses of this function is if the grammar is arranged such that
recursive rules do not have a terminal before the recursively called nonterminal,
the matcher will endlessly loop through that recursive rule (or set of rules)
without consuming any of the fragment.
